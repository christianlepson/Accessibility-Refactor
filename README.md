# HTML and CSS Accessibility Refactor
This project involved taking a set of interlinked wehpages that suffered from various accessibility flaws and refining and updating them so they are accessible to vision and sight-impaired users. Changes include:

- Adding ARIA landmarks
- Properly labeling form elements
- Adjusting color scheme and font sizing for higher contrast for vision-impaired users
- Adding descriptive alt tags to images when necessary
